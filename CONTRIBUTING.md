# Contributing

Firstly, thank you for considering to contribute.

## How to contribute

There are multiple ways to contribute to this project. The most common way is to fork this repository, make changes and open a pull request. If you're not sure what to work on, you can check the issues tab to see if there are any open issues which you can work on or if you have any ideas, you can open a new issue and discuss it.

### Reporting bugs

If you find any bugs, you can report them by [creating an bug report](https://github.com/AkashRajpurohit/ts-npm-template/issues/new?template=bug_report.yml). Please make sure to include as much information as possible so that it's easier to reproduce the bug.

### Requesting features

If you feel that the project is missing a feature, you can raise a [feature request](https://github.com/AkashRajpurohit/ts-npm-template/issues/new?template=feature_request.yml) on GitHub and I'll look into it or better yet, you can open a pull request with the feature.

### Commit messages

Please make sure to follow the [conventional commit messages](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) format while making changes. While this is not a strict requirement, it is the general practice followed in this project.

### Changesets

This project uses [changesets](https://github.com/changesets/changesets) to manage versioning and changelogs. If you're making changes to the project, make sure to create a changeset for the changes you've made.

You can create a changeset by running the following command:

```bash
pnpm changeset
```

Choose the type of change you've made and provide a summary of the changes. This will create a new changeset file in the `.changeset` folder.
